# PhotoShop Scripts (CS6)

Just a collection of resources for PhotoShop I have either made or modded.

## What do I do with them?

* Install the toolkit using the ZXP file, then a panel will be available in Window/Extensions
* or
* Place these in photoshop/presets/scripts

### Add Extention

Will add whatever you place in the promt box to the end of selected layers, I use it to add file extentions for [Slicy](http://macrabbit.com/slicy) i.e .png .jpg


### Layers to folder

Will create a folder with the same name as the selected layer, then will move the layer inside the folder. Also works will multiple selected layers.
